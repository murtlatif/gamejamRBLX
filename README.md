## What is MineBlox?

MineBlox is a game created during a 24 hour game jam hosted by the [scriptersCF](https://scripterscf.com/) community. The theme of the game was "2D", so I created MineBlox, which is a 2D mining game where players can dig for more rare and valuable ores as they dig further down, which they can then use to purchase better equipment for their next mining adventures!
